        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this task is to prepare public datasets for more effective use in training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). You are required to reformat a specific subset of a public dataset into a structured, consistent format to facilitate its usability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Dataset Selection and Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dataset:** You are assigned the `Headline` subset of the [AdaptLLM/finance-tasks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdaptLLM/finance-tasks) dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task Description:** Each entry in the `input` column contains multiple \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions alongside their respective answers. Your task is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Develop a Python script to parse and separate each question and its answer from the entry.\n",
        "  - Save each question-answer pair in a structured JSON format as follows:\n",
        "    ```json\n",
        "    {\n",
        "      \"id\": \"<unique_identifier>\",\n",
        "      \"Question\": \"<question_text>\",\n",
        "      \"Answer\": \"<answer_text>\"\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - You are encouraged to introduce additional attributes if needed to preserve the integrity and completeness of the information. Adding relevant tag information is strongly recommended.\n",
        "- **Automation Requirement:** The task must be completed using Python. Manual editing or data manipulation is strictly prohibited. Your script should efficiently handle variations in data format within the column.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Deliverables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reformatted Dataset:** Provide the schema of the final format you adopted for saving the results.\n",
        "- **Transformation Code:** Submit the complete code used for converting the dataset into the designated format.\n",
        "- **Statistics:** Report the total number of question-answer pairs extracted from the dataset.\n",
        "- **Performance Metrics:** Document the time taken to complete the dataset cleanup and transformation process.\n"
